# Ancient Script Decoder Summarization System

This document describes the advanced summarization and historical context extraction capabilities of the Ancient Script Decoder system.

## Summarization Techniques

The system uses multiple summarization approaches to generate high-quality, context-aware summaries:

### 1. Extraction-based Summarization
Identifies and extracts key sentences from the original text that best represent the content. The system uses:
- TF-IDF scoring to find important terms
- Positional weighting (sentences at beginning/end often contain key information)
- Named entity recognition to preserve important references
- Multi-factor scoring to prioritize sentences

### 2. Abstraction-based Summarization
Creates new sentences that capture the meaning of the original text. Works by:
- Analyzing semantic structure
- Identifying core concepts and relationships
- Generating new, concise phrasing that preserves meaning

### 3. Hybrid Summarization
Combines extraction and abstraction approaches for optimal results:
- Extracts key content and structure from the original text
- Reformulates to create more natural and concise summaries
- Maintains factual accuracy while improving readability
- Preserves historical and cultural nuances

The system automatically selects the appropriate approach based on the text type, or users can explicitly request a specific algorithm through the API.

## Keyword Extraction

The system employs a sophisticated keyword extraction system:

1. **Multi-factor scoring**:
   - TF-IDF to identify terms unique to the document
   - Positional importance (words in headings, first/last paragraphs)
   - Context recognition (terms near established important terms)
   - Domain-specific weighting (historical terms given higher weight)

2. **Bigram analysis** for multi-word concepts:
   - Recognizes phrases like "Middle Kingdom" or "Battle of Actium"
   - Preserves important multi-word entities that would lose meaning when split

## Historical Context Metadata

The system extracts rich historical metadata to provide context for translated manuscripts:

### Time Period Detection
- Identifies specific time periods mentioned (e.g., "Old Kingdom", "Classical Antiquity")
- Detects date formats and century references
- Maps relative time references to absolute chronology
- Provides approximate date ranges when exact dates are unavailable

### Geographical Context
- Extracts location references from the text
- Maps historical regions to modern geographical areas
- Identifies cultural spheres of influence

### Cultural Context
- Determines associated cultures and civilizations
- Extracts information about religious practices, social structures
- Identifies references to significant historical figures
- Recognizes cultural artifacts and technologies

### Material Context
- Identifies writing material (clay, papyrus, stone, etc.)
- Recognizes scribal techniques and traditions
- Provides context about preservation methods

### Historical Events
- Extracts references to significant events (battles, treaties, reigns)
- Identifies relationships between events
- Places events in chronological context

## Domain-Specific Templates

The system applies different summarization templates based on content categorization:

1. **Scientific texts**: Emphasizes methodologies, findings, and conclusions
2. **Historical narratives**: Focuses on events, timelines, and key figures
3. **Literary works**: Captures themes, narrative arc, and stylistic elements
4. **Religious/spiritual texts**: Preserves doctrinal concepts and ritual descriptions
5. **Political documents**: Highlights power structures, declarations, and agreements

## Output Customization

Researchers can customize the summarization process through API parameters:
- Summary length (short, medium, long)
- Focus area (customize which aspects receive emphasis)
- Target audience (general public, specialists, educational)
- Language complexity (adjusts vocabulary and sentence structure)

## Benefits for Historical Research

The intelligent summarization system provides several benefits:
- Rapid comprehension of lengthy manuscripts
- Identification of thematic connections across different texts
- Contextual understanding of cultural and historical significance
- Enhanced discovery of relationships between historical entities
