# Test script for verifying the enhanced summarization features:
# - Unique, content-aware summarization for different texts
# - Support for different summarization algorithms (extractive, hybrid)
# - Domain-specific templates based on content type (scientific, historical, literary)
# - Improved keyword extraction with TF-IDF-like scoring and concept diversity
# - Bigram support for more specific concept identification

The word mathematics comes from the Greek word mathematike, meaning the art of learning. Greek mathematics constituted a major period in the history of mathematics, fundamental in respect of geometry and the idea of formal proof. Greek mathematics also influenced Hindu and Islamic mathematics.",

Because of their pictorial nature, hieroglyphs were difficult to write and required extensive training to read. Hieroglyphs stopped being used in everyday writing when the Coptic alphabet was introduced. The decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs was finally accomplished in the 1820s by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion.",
